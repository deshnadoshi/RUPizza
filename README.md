# RUPizza
Your team will develop a software for RU Pizza to manage the pizza orders. Your team must use JavaFX to develop
the GUIs for taking orders, placing orders, and cancelling orders. The pizzeria offers five specialty pizzas, Deluxe,
Supreme, Meatzza, Seafood and Pepperoni, with store customized toppings as shown in the table below. The pizzeria
also offers “build your own” pizzas, which allow the customers to choose the toppings they like, up to 7 toppings.
The store charges $1 each for extra cheese and extra sauce. The store staff will be the one using the software to take
the orders from the customers. Each order is uniquely identified by an order number. 
The system shall be able to keep track of all the store orders placed by the store staff and allow the store staff to
browse the store orders and cancel an order. These shall include displaying all the store orders by the order numbers, the order total for each order with 2 decimal places, and the list of pizzas in each order. 
The system shall be able to export the store orders and save them in a text file. Each order shall include the order number, the list of pizzas with selected toppings, sauce/extra sauce, extra cheese, and the order total.
